[Latest release](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/eduka-scores/kdocdadhfpdpkopnegnejlgkfjbdbcih?hl=en)

## Improvements

Create an issue if you find any issues, or add a pull request if you have improved anything. Standard stuff, any help is appreciated.

This is my first JS code, if you have any constructive criticism please provide it and help me improve.

## Motivations

Eduka platform has many security holes that can be exploited. This project is a relatively simple showcase of the unsecure state of Eduka website. I hope, that by making this extension and source code public, Eduka team will be forced into fixing their vulnerable system.

## More about Eduka

I have also created a repo, that in the future will contain a write-up of all Eduka vulnerabilities that I and others have found so far. It is a work in progress and can be found [here](https://github.com/Adomas-Alimas/EdukaExploits).
