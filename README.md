# EdukaScores

A google chrome extension that provides your scores for <https://www.eduka.lt/> quizzes real-time.

[Latest release](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/eduka-scores/kdocdadhfpdpkopnegnejlgkfjbdbcih?hl=en)

## Motivations

Eduka platform has many security holes that can be exploited. This project is a relatively simple showcase of the unsecure state of Eduka website. I hope, that by making this extension and source code public, Eduka team will be forced into fixing their vulnerable system.

## More about Eduka

I have also created a repo, that in the future will contain a write-up of all Eduka vulnerabilities that I and others have found so far. It is a work in progress and can be found [here](https://github.com/Adomas-Alimas/EdukaExploits).
